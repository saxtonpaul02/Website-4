                    <p>The University of Deseret was established in 1850 to be the state university. The 
                    name changed in 1892 to the University of Utah to align with what the state ended up 
                    being called. This was also the Utes first football season. BYA's first season was in 
                    1896. The name was changed to Brigham Young University in 1903, but because of a 
                    player death, BYA/BYU did not play football from about 1900 to 1920.</p>

                        <p>Over the years, these two schools have met in football competition 101 times,
                        but the first meet up was on April 6, 1986. The Utes came up with a 12-4 
                        victory. It's hard to believe that BYU really safetied the Utes twice, but the only  
                        known facts about this meeting is the location (Salt Lake City) and the final score.</p>
